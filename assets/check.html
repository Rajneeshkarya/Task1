                        A security architect plays a crucial role in designing the network and computer security

                        designing
                        elements of security. Without a security architect, a company’s security system is vulnerable to
                        attacks. The security architect first creates a design based on the needs of the company and

                        works together with the programming team to build the final structure. Besides building the

                        team.
                        This trend shows that companies have grown aware of the threats of cyber crimes and the
                        potential
                        damage such attacks can cause. The CISO is a senior-level executive within an organization that

                        technologies. The CISO works with the staff to identify, develop, implement, and maintain
